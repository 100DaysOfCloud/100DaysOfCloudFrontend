Rules
=====

This document is Work In Progress. Please wait for its completion before starting the challenge! We are making this available early to gather community feedback 

The #100DaysofCloud challenge is inspired by [ Alex Kallaway's #100DaysofCode](https://www.100daysofcode.com/about/) challenge.
The challenge is that you advance your cloud knowledge through 100 days by documenting your studies and creating hands-on micro-cloud projects.

The rules outlined here are to:
-   help us track your progress
-   hold you accountable 
-   Make it easier for other cloud journeyers to find you

We think this structured challenge will result in the best outcome.
You don't have to follow the rules here, but if you want to claim our prizes or be highlighted within the #100DaysOfCloud community, closely following the rules will increase your chances.

#### 1] Copying the 100DaysOfCloud Journey Template

We have created a Github Repository that is intended to be Copied by you.
We have provided instructions in the template where you need to update main README.me with your own personal information and we have outlined your 100 Days.
You will need to create your own Github account.
By Copying and using this template we can track your progress. This will help us give your more exposure. We will be able to highlight your progress on #100DaysOfCloud's main site and on social media.
We encourage you to document your journey in your developer blog that is self-hosted by you though we only count days that are documented in the official copy of the provided GitHub repository.

<https://github.com/100DaysOfCloud/100DaysOfCloud>

#### 2] Time Commitment and Frequency/Consistency of Days

The amount of time you put in per day is up to you. We suggest that you attempt 1 hour of time.
We have some flexibility in terms of days. It's not required that you log every day consecutively. What is important is that you do 100 days and you do the best to document your journey in the greatest technical depth possible for you. 
Our system automatically tracks your progress when using the official copy of the Journey Template. You will be scored based on consistency from 0.0 to 1.0
If your score drops below a particular threshold eg. 0.7 you will not be eligible for current or future #100DaysOfCloud prizes.

#### 3] Reporting Progress

When you complete a day you need to announce it either on LinkedIn, Twitter or both and your social post requires three things:

1.  the #100DaysOfCloud hashtag
2.  Indication of day [3/100]
3.  Link to your progress (personal dev blog or the specific day in your Github Copied Journey Template)

Eg. [11/100] #100DaysOfCloud Today I set up my very own Message Queue using #AWS SQS!

Based on which social media platform you plan to post to join our groups:

-   If you plan to post on Twitter follow the [Twitter List](https://twitter.com/i/lists/1277324332147118081)
-   If you plan to post on LinkedIn join the [LinkedIn Group](https://www.linkedin.com/groups/13884435/)

#### 4] Structuring Your Daily Post

An ideal example of this is fellow Cloud Journeyer Johan Rin
-   Explain your personal reason or interest
-   Include an architectural diagram
-   Include screenshots of the console or application
-   Include code blocks if possible
-   Try to write it like a mini tutorial
